## Steps
1. Scan spec for `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION:` markers.
2. Limit to top 3 (scope > security > UX impact).
3. For each, present option table (A/B/C/Custom) with implications.
4. Await user selections.
5. Apply answers; remove markers; add to Assumptions or Decisions section.
6. Re-run validation; SUCCESS if zero markers remain.
