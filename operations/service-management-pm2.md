# Service Management with PM2 (Template)

Pattern for supervising ingestion and API services.

Include an `ecosystem.config.js` with cron-restarted ingestion and persistent API processes.

See `operations/ingestion-pattern.md` for ingestion lifecycle; see `operations/maintenance-policy.md` for archival rotation.
