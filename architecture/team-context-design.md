# Team Context Design (Template)

## Purpose
Enable teams to quickly discover related projects, documentation, and workflows by linking context across repositories.

## Patterns
- Use `context.json` to list related repos, docs, and automations
- Reference onboarding guides and architecture docs
- Encourage journaling and handoff documentation

## Example
See `context.json` in the project root for a discoverable map of your ecosystem.
