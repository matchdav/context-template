# Archive Directory (Template)

Holds rotated or historical artifacts no longer part of the active working surface.

## Structure
- `archive/journal/` — Archived high-resolution session notes after synthesis.
- `archive/standups/` — Monthly folders of past standup reports.
- `archive/digests/` (optional) — Prior daily digests by month.

## Guidelines
1. Archive only after synthesis (insight extracted).
2. Maintain lightweight index files if discoverability becomes a problem.
3. Never modify archived content—append errata in new journal entries if needed.
