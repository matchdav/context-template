# Agent Handoff Protocol

## Purpose
This prompt provides comprehensive instructions for AI coding agents to understand the current state of work and continue development tasks effectively. Use this when handing off work between sessions or when a new agent needs to pick up where you left off.

---

## üéØ Quick Orientation

### Current Context Access
**ALWAYS START HERE** - These are your essential context sources:

1.  **Daily Digest** (`~/github/context/daily-digest.md`)
    - Auto-generated at 9 AM daily from Jira and GitHub
    - Shows active tickets, PRs, and recent activity
    - **Read this FIRST** to understand current priorities

2.  **Active Pull Request** 
    ```bash
    gh pr view
    ```
    - Shows the current PR you're working on
    - Includes description, status checks, and comments

3.  **Git Status & Branch**
    ```bash
    git status
    git branch --show-current
    ```
    - Verify which branch you're on
    - Check for uncommitted changes

4.  **Jira Ticket Details**
    ```bash
    jira issue view <TICKET-ID>
    ```
    - Get acceptance criteria, requirements, and context
    - Check comments and attachments

---

## üîç Discovery Process

### Step 1: Understand What Was Being Worked On

#### Check Active Work
```bash
# View current Jira tickets
jira issue list -q "assignee = currentUser() AND status IN ('In Progress', 'Selected for Development')"

# View your open PRs
gh pr list --author @me --state open

# Check the most recent PR
gh pr view

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10
```

#### Check Documentation Trail
Look for these in the codebase:
- `docs/*-handoff.md` - Explicit handoff documents
- `docs/*-summary.md` - Implementation summaries
- `docs/*-implementation-journal.md` - Detailed development logs
- `docs/*-testing-checklist.md` - QA procedures
- `decision-records/` - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### Check Terminal History
```bash
# What commands were run recently?
history | tail -20
```

### Step 2: Verify the Environment

#### Workspace Structure
```
onenews/              # Main OneNews platform (web + API)
duplex-quartz/        # Quartz email platform
duplex-infra-services/# Infrastructure & tooling
duplex-feature-flags/ # ConfigCat feature flag management
context/              # This repo - documentation & context
```

#### Check Current Directory
```bash
pwd
ls -la
```

#### Verify Dependencies
```bash
# For Node.js projects
pnpm install

# For Python projects (content-firehose)
cd content-firehose && make test

# Check environment variables
cat .env | grep -v "^#" | head -10
```

### Step 3: Review Recent Changes

#### Git Diff
```bash
# View uncommitted changes
git diff

# View staged changes
git diff --staged

# Compare with main branch
git diff main..HEAD
```

#### Pull Request Context
```bash
# View PR details with comments
gh pr view --comments

# View PR checks status
gh pr checks

# View PR diff
gh pr diff
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### "I don't know what I'm supposed to be working on"

1.  Check daily digest: `cat ~/github/context/daily-digest.md`
2.  List your Jira tickets: `jira issue list -q "assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done"`
3.  Check recent git activity: `git log --oneline --author="$(git config user.name)" -20`
4.  Look for handoff docs: `ls docs/*-handoff.md`

### "The environment won't start"

**For web-services:**
```bash
# 1. Check .env files exist
ls web-services/{onenews,shiftnews}/.env

# 2. Install dependencies
cd web-services && pnpm install

# 3. Check Node version
node --version  # Should be 20.x or 22.x

# 4. Clear cache if needed
rm -rf .nuxt .output node_modules/.cache
pnpm install
```

**For content-firehose:**
```bash
# 1. Check .env exists
ls content-firehose/.env

# 2. Test with Docker
cd content-firehose && make run

# 3. Check Docker is running
docker ps
```

### "Tests are failing"

1.  **Check if it's your changes:**
    ```bash
    git stash
    pnpm test
    git stash pop
    ```

2.  **Look for test output:**
    - Read the error messages carefully
    - Check file paths mentioned in errors
    - Look for missing mocks or imports

3.  **Common fixes:**
    ```bash
    # Clear test cache
    pnpm test --clearCache
    
    # Update snapshots (if needed)
    pnpm test -u
    
    # Run single test file
    pnpm test path/to/file.test.ts
    ```

### "I need to coordinate with someone"

**Check Jira ticket** for:
- Watchers
- Comments mentioning people
- "Relates to" links to other tickets

**Slack channels:**
- #onenews - OneNews development
- #quartz - Quartz development
- #dx-team - DX team general

**Key people mentioned in docs:**
- Tristan - Feature flags and split testing
- Check CODEOWNERS file for code areas

### "I need access to something"

**1Password vaults:**
- `Duplex General` - Most .env files and credentials
- Search for: "OneNews dotenv", "content-api dotenv"

**AWS Access:**
- Credentials in .env files have read-only staging access
- For write access, ask in Slack

**ConfigCat:**
- Credentials in 1Password
- Feature flag configs in `duplex-feature-flags` repo

## üéØ Before You End Your Session

### Create/Update Handoff Document

1.  **Capture current state:**
    ```markdown
    ## Status: [Current status]
    
    Last commit: [hash and message]
    PR: [link if exists]
    
    ## What I Just Did
    - [List recent work]
    
    ## What's Next
    1. [Next immediate step]
    2. [Then this]
    
    ## Blockers/Questions
    - [Any issues]
    ```

2.  **Commit documentation:**
    ```bash
    git add docs/
    git commit -m "docs: update handoff for DXT-1234"
    git push
    ```

3.  **Update Jira:**
    ```bash
    jira issue comment DXT-1234 "Updated handoff doc. Status: [...]"
    ```

### Clean Workspace

```bash
# Commit or stash changes
git status
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: [description]"
# or
git stash save "WIP: [description]"

# Push if on feature branch
git push origin HEAD
```

### Update Context Files

## üí° Tips for Effective Handoffs

1.  **Write for your future self** - Assume you'll forget everything
2.  **Be specific** - "Run pnpm test" not "run tests"
3.  **Include context** - WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT
4.  **Link everything** - PR numbers, Jira tickets, Slack threads
5.  **Test your handoff** - Could someone pick this up cold?
6.  **Update as you go** - Don't wait until the end
7.  **Use checkboxes** - Makes progress visible
8.  **Note what DIDN'T work** - Save future you from dead ends

---

## üÜò When You're Stuck

1.  **Check the daily digest** - Might have relevant info
2.  **Search the codebase** - `grep -r "similar-pattern"`
3.  **Check git history** - `git log -p --all -S "search-term"`
4.  **Look at related PRs** - `gh pr list --search "keyword"`
5.  **Review ADRs** - `ls decision-records/`
6.  **Ask in Slack** - Include what you've tried
7.  **Update handoff doc** - Document the blocker for next session

---

**Remember:** The goal is to make the next session (or agent) as productive as possible. Invest time in documentation now to save multiples of that time later.
