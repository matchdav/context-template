# Context Template

This repository is a template for creating a central hub for managing perspective, workflows, and automation across all your active projects. It acts as a meta-repository, providing a single source of truth that enables efficient context switching and seamless collaboration between developers and AI agents.

## Core Principles

A successful context repository revolves around a few key principles, which you should adapt in your own `constitution.md`:

*   **Context is King**: All work begins and ends with context. This repository should be the definitive source for project status, architecture, and workflows.
*   **Systematic Workflows**: Adhere to standardized, repeatable protocols for all development tasks (e.g., `PICKUP`, `HANDOFF`, `DEBUGGING`). These are not suggestions; they are the way you work.
*   **Automation First**: Any repetitive task should be automated. This repository contains the scripts and tools to enforce this principle.

## How It Works

The ecosystem is designed to be self-discoverable. Here are the key components:

1.  **Daily Digest**: The `daily-digest.md` is the primary entry point for any work session. It can be automatically generated each morning and provides a snapshot of active tickets, open pull requests, and recent team activity. A sample automation script is provided in `automations/daily-digest.sh`.
2.  **Standardized Protocols**: The `prompts/` directory contains markdown-based checklists and templates for common developer workflows. `PICKUP.md` and `HANDOFF.md` are provided as examples.
3.  **Automation Scripts**: The `automations/` directory houses scripts that power the ecosystem.
4.  **Centralized Documentation**: The `architecture/` and `perspectives/` directories store cross-cutting concerns and project-specific knowledge.

## Getting Started: The Daily Workflow

A typical work session follows a predictable rhythm:

1.  **Morning Sync**: Start your day by reviewing `daily-digest.md` to understand current priorities and tasks.
    ```bash
    cat daily-digest.md
    ```
2.  **Pickup Work**: Use the `prompts/PICKUP.md` protocol to orient yourself to a specific task. This involves reviewing the ticket, related code, and any existing handoff documents.
3.  **Do the Work**: Implement changes, write tests, and document decisions. Use a local `.context/journal/` directory within a project to log your process.
4.  **Handoff Work**: At the end of your session, use the `prompts/HANDOFF.md` protocol to create a clear, concise handoff document. This ensures that context is preserved for the next session.

## Customizing The Template

1.  **Fork or Use as Template:** Create your own repository from this template.
2.  **Customize `constitution.md`:** Define the principles, roles, and workflows for your team.
3.  **Customize `automations/daily-digest.sh`:** Update the script to integrate with your project management tools (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues).
4.  **Populate `architecture/` and `perspectives/`:** Add your own architectural diagrams, decision records, and project-specific context.
5.  **Start Using the Workflow:** Begin your daily work by following the "Morning Sync -> Pickup -> Do -> Handoff" cycle.
